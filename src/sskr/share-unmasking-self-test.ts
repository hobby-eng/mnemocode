// The self-test of shares masked with dates (sskr/share-unmasking.ts): the phrase that a restored
// set holds, the masked phrase of the published Seedshift vector, unmasked with its whole date,
// searched where a digit of it is forgotten with the wallet deciding, and refused with more dates
// than it takes; and, with the host's SSKR library, shares of that masked phrase with unread
// colors repaired together and then unmasked with the forgotten digit. It answers later, so
// core/self-test.ts runs it only in the full self-test.
//
// From the host it needs the master fingerprint of a phrase, for the wallet check, and optionally
// its SharePlatform (sskr/share-platform.ts). It holds public test data, no secret.
//
// Host-neutral: it imports only core modules, @scure/bip39 and other host-neutral sskr modules.
