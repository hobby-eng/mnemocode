// The self-test of the repair of damaged Shamir shares (sskr/repair.ts, sskr/joint-repair.ts,

// from the checksum of one share; the marks that are refused; and, with the host's SSKR library,
// shares repaired together, also one of which nothing could be read. core/self-test.ts runs the
// quick part before every command of the command line and all of it in the full self-test.
//
// From the host it needs, for the full check only, its SharePlatform (sskr/share-platform.ts). It
// holds public test data, no secret.
//
// Host-neutral: it imports only other host-neutral sskr modules and core/self-test-check.ts.
