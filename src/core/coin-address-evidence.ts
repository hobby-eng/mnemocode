// An address of one coin as wallet evidence: whether a BIP39 phrase, with its BIP39 passphrase, is
// the wallet that has the address at an account, branch and index, or among the addresses that
// follow. It takes the coin itself, a Coin of core/coins/, not its name, so that a host builds in
// only the coins it offers: the Dash edition of the Deriver takes core/coins/dash.ts alone, without
// the Bitcoin evidence of core/wallet-evidence.ts or the list of every coin (core/coins.ts), and
// carries no other coin's code or words. wallet-evidence.ts compares its "coin-address" kind here.
//
// From the host it needs PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, as core/master-fingerprint.ts takes it, which may
// answer at once (match) or later (matchAsync). It checks one phrase at a time and keeps nothing:
// the seed and every key derived are wiped before it returns.
//
// Host-neutral: it imports only core/master-fingerprint.ts, core/address-scan.ts, the types of
// core/coins/coin.ts and @scure/bip32 (test/portable-modules.test.ts).
