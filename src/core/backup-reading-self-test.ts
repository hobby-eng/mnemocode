// phrase, also with marks; and, with the host's master fingerprint, the encoded fingerprint and the
// search that it decides. core/self-test.ts runs the quick part before every command of the command
// line and all of it in the full self-test.

// From the host it needs, for the full check only, the master fingerprint of a phrase. It holds
// public test data, no secret.
//
// Host-neutral: it imports only other core modules, and through them the share forms.
