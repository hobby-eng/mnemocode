// The self-test of the addresses of one coin family (core/coins/), which each family's module
// builds from its own vectors (dash-self-test.ts and the others beside it), so that a host that
// builds in one family, such as the Dash edition of the Deriver, carries the code, vectors and
// words of no other: every address of the public phrase found where its wallets put it, an address
// of the wallet given at another place not found, a second address found among the first two and
// not at the first alone, and addresses that no wallet can match refused, naming why.
//
// It derives every key from the published seeds of the public phrase (master-fingerprint-
// self-test.ts), so it needs nothing from the host. It holds public test data, no secret.
//
// The vectors: the Bitcoin mainnet values at index 0 are the published vectors of BIP84 and BIP86
// and, computed independently with Python's hashlib, of BIP44 and BIP49; the Dash Platform ones
// are the official DIP17/DIP18 vectors. The others were first computed with @scure/bip32,
// @noble/hashes, @noble/curves and @scure/base, and ethers for EIP-55, the libraries this code
// uses too; all of them were then recomputed with a pure Python implementation that shares no
// library with it (its own Keccak, Bech32 and Bech32m, CashAddr, Base58 and XRP's alphabet) and
// first reproduces the published vectors, and they agree.
//
// Host-neutral: it imports only core/coin-address-evidence.ts and other self-test modules.
