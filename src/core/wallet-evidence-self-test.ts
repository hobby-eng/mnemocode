// The self-test of Bitcoin wallet evidence (core/wallet-evidence.ts): the master fingerprint, the
// master and account extended public keys in their forms, an address in each of the four profiles,
// a compressed public key and a WIF, on mainnet and testnet, and a passphrase; an address found
// among several in a row (the scan of --scan-gap) and not before them; evidence of another
// wallet that does not match, and evidence that no wallet can match, refused. A host that builds
// in wallet evidence adds it to its self-test (SelfTestHost.features, MnemoCodeSelfTest.core), so
// that a build without Bitcoin carries none of it.
//
// It derives every key from the published seeds of the public phrase (master-fingerprint-
// self-test.ts), so it needs nothing from the host. It holds public test data, no secret: the WIF
// here is the private key of a public test vector.
//
// Host-neutral: it imports only core/wallet-evidence.ts and other self-test modules.
